# Transformations
Calculates the new coordinates of points of a shape with any number of verticies after the transformations translate, reflect, rotate, and dilate.
  - x and y coordinates of points have to be seperated by at least one space and/or comma
  - capitalization of T, r, R, and D matters
  - to stop entering points, simply leave the input blank
  - transformation equations are accepted, must be in format:
    - T(x, y)r(eq)R(x, y, a)D(x, y, s)
    - as with points, arguments must be seperated with at least one space and/or comma
    - transformation equations have no length limit, transformations are evaluated from *left to right* as is in math
